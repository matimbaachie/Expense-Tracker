# Expense Tracker

## Project Summary  
I built a robust Expense Tracker application that enables users to efficiently manage and categorize their expenses. The application is secured with Azure AD authentication, providing enterprise-grade security for personal finance data.

The backend is an ASP.NET Core API that performs CRUD operations on expense records using Entity Framework Core connected to Azure SQL Database. The React frontend integrates MSAL.js to authenticate users seamlessly with Azure AD.

## Key Features  
- Azure AD secured login for enterprise users.  
- Create, edit, delete, and view expenses by category and date.  
- Responsive React interface with intuitive forms and tables.  
- Backend APIs protected by Azure AD access tokens.  
- Database designed with EF Core migrations and relational integrity.  
- Full deployment pipeline to Azure App Services.

## Technologies Used  
- React with MSAL.js for Azure AD authentication  
- ASP.NET Core Web API with Azure AD middleware  
- Entity Framework Core, Azure SQL Database  
- Azure App Service for frontend and backend hosting  

## How I Delivered It  
- Configured Azure AD applications for secure authentication flow.  
- Modeled and implemented expense entities and DB context with EF Core.  
- Developed RESTful APIs secured with Azure AD bearer tokens.  
- Created React components to handle state management and API integration.  
- Automated deployment to Azure using App Services and GitHub Actions.  
- Provided user guides and developer documentation for easy onboarding.
